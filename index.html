            <p>Hi, I am Nilesh Laxmi. Professionally, I have worked for two companies NTTDATA Services and Dell International Services
            till now. My professional career started from Nov, 2014. In my college years, I was involved in mobile applications
            development. I have developed and published around 15 phone apps in my college years. My mobile applications were
            created on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. So I was able to capitalise on my these knowledge during my professional years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Personally I love to read books, posts and manga. I am avid reader of Medium and Quora posts. I love to play cricket,
                football and do swimming. I also love to do adventure sports. Till now I have done only paragliding and flying fox.
